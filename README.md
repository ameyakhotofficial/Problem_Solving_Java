# 8-puzzle
Java program to solve the 8 puzzle problem (using branch and bound algorithm)
 
### Problem:
https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr10/cos226/assignments/8puzzle.html
 
### Compile and run
 
Use an IDE to run the Puzzle.java file. (My Preference : ECLIPSE IDE)
Keep the Node.java file and Puzzle.java in the same package while you Puzzle.java.

Or, use a CLI to run the code. 
Please find the instruction to run the code from CLI here:
